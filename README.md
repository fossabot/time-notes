# time-notes package

This package lets you easily take timestamped notes for e.g. observation tasks or meeting minutes.

## Usage

When enabled, time-notes replaces the functionality of the `enter` key, adding a human and machine-readable timestamp in front of the line of text each time the user hits `enter`. Quickly toggle this behavior on/off with `ctrl-alt-t`
